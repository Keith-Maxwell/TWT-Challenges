# smoothing graph line challenge

[Discord Challenge](https://discordapp.com/channels/501090983539245061/713841395965624490/718213999916744744)

## Task

Smooth out a line on a graph given the list of the y points. (the challenge assumes a continuous sequence of digits for the x points so there is no need to worry about that)

## Format

- The code needs to be in a function
- The function needs to be called `smooth`
- The function needs to accept a list of y points
- The function needs to return a new list of y points (no need to check for bad data, although you can if you want to)

## Grading

The grading will be a bit different this time, since there really isn't a sure way to unit test this we'll be trying out a different grading system:

First we'll be relying on you guys. Once you submit your solution, see what other people came up with, if you like something react to it with a !. Everyone's input on this first part is really important, so please check out like maybe 3-4 other solutions.
You can use [this code](https://paste.pythondiscord.com/etesopidag.py) to check out other solutions, just make sure all the y points are in a list in a json file and the solution you're checking are all in the same folder. (you'll need to make sure you have the matplotlib, json, and os libraries installed, whichever ones are not builtin)

Second part is staff will look over the top 10 most liked solutions and choose 5 of them. There is no specific date on that set yet, all that's known for sure is that at that time new submissions will no longer be accepted and it will be somewhere near the end of the challenge. Will keep you updated if/when we have a date set for this

Oh and, **no libraries/imports allowed for the function**, however you can use the script provided (or your matplotlib knowledge) to see how your function works out. **No resubmissions** either
