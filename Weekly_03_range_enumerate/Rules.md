# Generator replicas challenge

https://discordapp.com/channels/501090983539245061/680851798340272141/719570962802016276

## Task

Recreate range() and enumerate()

## Grading criteria and submission

Function names: erange(), numerate()
They simply need to do the same thing the original ones do. You cannot use the existing ones to create the replicas.

For submission please use the discord code block, you can type t.tag discord code in #bot-commands for more information on that. Put the two functions in the same discord block or separate ones, doesn't really matter just make sure it's all in one message because you can only submit once

## Note

- I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to double check your solution before submitting, with the few challenges we've had already there were so many people rushing to submit and ending up making the most stupid mistakes they could have easily avoided if they took their time and double checked their solution
