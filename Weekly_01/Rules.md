# Year to century converter challenge

Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc. **No libraries/imports allowed**

Submission format:

```py
def yearToCentury(year):
  # your code
  return century
```

Examples at work:

`>>> print(yearToCentury(355))`
`4`

`>>> print(yearToCentury(5698))`
`57`

`>>> print(yearToCentury(700))`
`7`

Note: The solution has to be in a function called `yearToCentury` which has to take in the year as an integer argument and return the century as an integer as well.
Otherwise the solution will not be valid.

P.S.
The return statement doesn't have to be at the end of the function. Just however it suits your code best
